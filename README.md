 ## Description
The project aims to develop an inventory management solution tailored for company administrators to oversee and manipulate inventory across various warehouses. This encompasses functionalities for viewing, adding, deleting, and modifying inventory items. A critical requirement for the system is an intuitive and straightforward user interface, ensuring that the administrative team can efficiently perform their duties. Additionally, the application will address complex scenarios like individual warehouse capacity limits and prevent the addition of items that would surpass these thresholds. The goal is to provide a seamless and efficient inventory management experience for administrators, accommodating the specific operational needs of their warehouses.
